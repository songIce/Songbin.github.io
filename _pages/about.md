I am a Research Assistant at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, message passing algorithms, statistical physics and signal processing.

I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Junjie Ma](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~mjj/index.html) and [Prof. Rishabh Dudeja](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/dudeja-rishabh/).
Previously, I was a Master's student in the Automation Department at Guangdong University of Technology, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haochuan Zhang](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/zhanghaochuan/zh_CN/index.htm).

**I am currently looking for a PhD position to further my research in these areas.**

You can find my CV here: [Songbin's Curriculum Vitae](../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
