I am a Research Assistant at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include signal processing, message passing algorithms, and high-dimensional statistics.

I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Junjie Ma](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~mjj/index.html) and [Prof. Rishabh Dudeja](https://www.columbia.edu/~rd2714/).
Previously, I was a Master's student in the Automation Department at Guangdong University of Technology, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haochuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-fwh6u0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I am currently looking for a PhD position to further my research in these areas.
