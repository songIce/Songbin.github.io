We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by
corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate
message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their
dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge
about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed
matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser
to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these
algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting
algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative
algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.
